# Key Insights
1. Business professionals lead in revenue generation,followed by white-collar workers and the self employed.
2. The blue-card category is significantly outperforming others with 46 million in revenue,while Platinum is underperforming with only 1 million.
3. In the high-income category ,males generate significantly more revenue with 22 million compared to 7 million from females.This indicates that high-income males are more engaged with their credit cards.Interestingly, in the medium-income category,both the males and females contribute equally,each generating 8 million.This suggests that the spending behaviour is more balanced between genders,whereas the high-income group shows a notable disparity.
4. In May 2023,males generated 2.5 million in revenue compared to only 1.8 million from females.This might indicate different spending behaviours or preferences between genders.
5. In the age group category,both the 40-50 and 50-60 age groups are showing strong performances.This indicates that these age groups are generating substantial revenue,possibly due to higher spending power or increased credit card usage.
6. The 20-30 age group is generating significantly lower revenue.This suggests that  younger adults might be less engaged with credit cards or have different spending patterns compared to older age groups.
7. Customer satisfaction rate is 3.1 out of 5.
# Recommendations
1. Improve strategies to boost the performance of the Platinum and gold category,like targeted promotions or improvements in card features.
2. To understand why males are outperforming females,investigate if there are specific factors influencing this trend,such as differences in spending habits or targeted marketing strategies.
3. Analyze feedback to pinpoint specific areas causing dissatisfaction.
4. Strengthen customer support to quickly resolve issues.
